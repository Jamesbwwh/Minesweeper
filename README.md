Current known Bugs / To do:

- User input name can be empty.
- No. of mines / left mines shown on GUI. [can make use of the variable "mines". it is variable holding the amount of mines in the game.
- Timer maybe ?
- Sorting of Highscore ? As currently it is no limit and order is by the order of insertion.
- Open / Save function of menu bar does nothing.
- Change the number 1,2,3,4,5 of the game to some colors ? 
- Perhaps icons on the mines ?
- Split the codes into functions
